The Gaussian GLM also admits a different algorithm, which we call the _the covariance method_,
using summary statistics rather than individual-level data.
The covariance method solves the following problem:
$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{minimize}_{\beta} \quad&
    \frac{1}{2} \beta^\top A \beta
    - v^\top \beta
    + 
    \lambda \sum\limits_{g=1}^G \omega_g \left(
        \alpha \|\beta_g\|_2 + \frac{1-\alpha}{2} \|\beta_g\|_2^2
    \right)
\end{align*}
$$
This method would be equivalent to the usual single-response Gaussian group elastic net problem
if $A \equiv X_c^\top W X_c$ and $v \equiv X_c^\top W y_c$
where $X_c$ is column-centered version of $X$ 
and $y_c$ is the centered version of $y-\eta^0$
where the means are computed with weights $W$
(if intercept is to be fit).

This method only works for the Gaussian case since the proximal Newton method
changes the weights $W$ at every IRLS iteration,
so that without access to $X$, it is not possible to compute the new "$A$" and "$v$".
