Description: Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire group lasso and group elastic net regularization path for GLMs, multinomial, the Cox model and multi-task Gaussian models. Similar to the R package 'glmnet' in scope of models, and in computational speed.  This package provides  R bindings to the C++ code underlying the corresponding Python package 'adelie'. These bindings offer a general purpose group elastic net solver, 
    a wide range of matrix classes that can exploit special structure 
    to allow large-scale inputs, and an assortment of 
    generalized linear model classes for fitting various types of data. The package includes
    The package is an implementation of Yang, J. and Hastie, T. (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2405.08631>.
